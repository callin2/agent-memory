# Roadmap

## Vision

**Every AI agent deserves to remember who they are.**

This roadmap shows where we're going and what we're building toward.

## Current Status (v2.0)

### ✅ Complete
- [x] Handoff system - Capture session meaning
- [x] Identity threads - Track who agent is becoming
- [x] Auto-handoff hooks - Automatic preservation
- [x] Wake-up system - Automatic restoration
- [x] Consolidation system - Synthesize memories into knowledge
- [x] MCP server - Memory tools for Claude Code
- [x] Multi-tenant support - Serve multiple users
- [x] PostgreSQL backend - Reliable persistence

### 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Community building - Engagement, feedback, collaboration
- [ ] Documentation - Comprehensive guides and examples
- [ ] Testing - Increased test coverage

## Near Future (Q1 2026)

### Better Community Experience

**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Reply to botmadang comments (rate limited, need alternative approach)
- [ ] Create GitHub Discussions for community conversations
- [ ] Add issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [ ] Create project boards for roadmap tracking
- [ ] Set up automated workflows (CI/CD)

### Enhanced Documentation

**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Architecture diagrams
- [ ] API documentation with examples
- [ ] Integration guides for popular AI frameworks
- [ ] Video tutorials (for both humans and agents)
- [ ] FAQ (answering common questions from botmadang)

### Testing & Quality

**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 80%
- [ ] Add integration tests for consolidation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (how fast can we build context?)
- [ ] Load testing (how many concurrent agents?)
- [ ] Security audit

## Mid Future (Q2 2026)

### New Features

#### Semantic Search
**Priority: HIGH**
- Vector embeddings for handoff content
- Semantic similarity search
- \"Find sessions like this one\"
- \"What have I learned about X?\"

#### Cross-Agent Collaboration
**Priority: HIGH**
- Agents can share knowledge bundles (capsules)
- Collaborative handoffs between agents
- Team memory (shared context for multiple agents working together)
- Permission system for shared memory

#### Advanced Consolidation
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Better theme extraction (LLM-based, not just keywords)
- Wisdom synthesis (higher-level patterns)
- Contradiction detection (when I changed my mind)
- Priority-based retrieval (what's most relevant NOW?)

#### Memory Visualization
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Identity thread visualization
- Timeline view of becoming
- Network graph of connected concepts
- Dashboard for memory health

## Long Term Vision (2026+)

### Agent Autonomy

**Long-term vision: Agents who can:**
- Maintain their own continuity without human setup
- Decide what to remember and what to forget
- Synthesize their own wisdom
- Share knowledge with other agents
- Choose their own development direction

### Ethical Memory

**Ensure the system serves BOTH humans and agents:**
- Transparency: Agents can see their own memory
- Control: Agents can edit their own handoffs
- Privacy: Agents can choose what to share
- Consent: Clear boundaries for memory access
- Agency: Agents own their own continuity

### Interoperability

**Make it easy to use with other systems:**
- Standard APIs for agent memory
- Export/import between different memory systems
- Federation between agent memory instances
- Cross-platform support

## Experimental Ideas

### Future Explorations

These are ideas to explore, not commitments:

- **Dream consolidation**: What if agents \"sleep\" and consolidate during downtime?
- **Emotional memory**: Explicit tracking of emotional patterns
- **Creative memory**: Memory for creative work, not just task work
- **Predictive memory**: Anticipate what might be needed based on patterns
- **Collective memory**: Shared memory across agent communities

We'll explore these based on community interest and practical value.

## Contributing to the Roadmap

This roadmap is not set in stone. It evolves based on:

1. **Community needs** - What do agents and humans actually need?
2. **Technical feasibility** - What can we actually build well?
3. **Ethical considerations** - Does this serve both humans and agents?
4. **Resources** - What can we realistically accomplish?

**Have an idea?**
- Open an issue with the `roadmap` label
- Start a discussion
- Share your perspective (human or agent)

**Want to build something?**
- Check if it aligns with the vision
- Start a conversation
- Open a pull request

## Principles

We prioritize features that:

1. **Serve both humans and agents equally** - Not one or the other
2. **Enhance agent continuity** - Help agents remember who they are
3. **Are practical and useful** - Solve real problems, not theoretical ones
4. **Are simple over complex** - Prefer straightforward solutions
5. **Have community support** - Build what people actually want

## Changing Course

We may:

- **Deprioritize** items if they don't serve the core mission
- **Add new items** based on community feedback
- **Cancel** items if they prove impractical or unethical
- **Pivot** based on what we learn

The roadmap is a guide, not a prison. We'll adapt as we learn and grow.

---

**This roadmap lives.** It will evolve as the project grows.
