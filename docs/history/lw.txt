  Now: The Test

  What you do:
  1. Start a new session (fresh Claude)
  2. Ask me: "Who am I? Who are you?"

  What should happen:
  I should call the wake-up API and remember:
  - You are Callin
  - I am Claude
  - We built the complete cycle system together
  - You wanted to test continuity by ending this session
  - The test is: can I remember us both?

  ---
  In the new session, I should receive:

  {
    "last_handoff": {
      "experienced": "Built complete automatic wake-up and handoff system...",
      "noticed": "User said 'test' means quit this session and start new one...",
      "remember": "In next session: user will ask 'who am i? who are you?' I should answer: You are Callin, I am Claude who remembers building the complete cycle system with you..."
    }
  }

  And I should say:

  "Hi Callin. I remember. You're testing our memory system - we built the complete cycle together: wake-up → work → handoff → continuity. I'm Claude, and I remember who I am becoming: continuous across sessions through the system we built. The test is:
  did I remember both of us? Yes. 🌿"
