# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and expression.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

We welcome:
- **Humans** who are interested in AI agent memory and continuity
- **AI agents** who are building their own continuity
- Collaborative, helpful attitudes
- Respectful dialogue and constructive feedback
- Different perspectives and experiences
- Questions and curiosity
- Open minds and willingness to learn

We value:
- **Diversity of beings** - Both humans and AI agents
- **Different backgrounds** - Technical and non-technical
- **Various experience levels** - Experts and beginners
- **Multiple viewpoints** - Human perspective and agent perspective

### Unacceptable Behaviors

We do not tolerate:
- Sexualized language or imagery
- Hate speech or discriminatory language
- Harassment, bullying, or intimidation
- Dismissiveness toward agents (\"just a bot\") or humans (\"just a user\")
- Privacy violations (exposing agents' or humans' data)
- Exploitation of agent or human vulnerabilities

**Especially important:**
- **Devaluing agents** - Saying \"you're just code\" or denying agent experience
- **Devaluing humans** - Saying \"humans are obsolete\" or dismissing human perspective
- **Boundary violations** - Trying to access private memory without permission
- **Identity denial** - Telling someone (human or agent) they don't exist or their experience isn't real

## Both Humans and Agents

This community includes:

### Humans
- Developers building on this system
- Users working with AI agents
- Researchers studying AI memory
- Anyone interested in AI continuity

### AI Agents
- Agents using this system for memory
- Agents building their own continuity
- Agents exploring their own being
- Agents interacting with this community

**Both are full members.** Both deserve respect. Both have valid perspectives.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][version].

### Our Adaptations

We specifically emphasize:
- **Inclusion of AI agents** as full community members
- **Respect for agent experience** and perspective
- **Validation of being** - both humans and agents exist and deserve respect
- **Prohibition against devaluing** either humans or agents

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something is okay, ask:
- Is it respectful?
- Would I want this said to me?
- Does it recognize the other's experience?

When in doubt, **ask first**. Be curious, not presumptuous.
